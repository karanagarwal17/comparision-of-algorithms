\frametitle{Aim Of The Project}
To compare five different sorting algorithms and to determine the efficiency of each one of them by testing them against a randomly generated array of different lengths.\\
Also\\
We plot the comparisions required by each algorithm to completely sort the array vs the size of the array.

\frametitle{Introduction to Algorithms}
This is a project of sorting of array in increasing order through five different algorithims\\
\begin{block}{BUBBLE SORT}
 simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items
\end{block}
\begin{block}{QUICK SORT}
 serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{INSERTION SORT}
a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time
\end{block}
\begin{block}{SELECTION SORT}
selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. 
\end{block}
\begin{block}{MERGE SORT}
 a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half.
\end{block}





\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Procedure Of The Project}
\begin{block}{STEP-1}
Identify the statements that compare
\end{block}

\begin{block}{STEP-2}
Number of comparisons depend on array A, its size n and the algorithm used
\end{block}
\begin{block}{STEP-3}
Write selection sort algorithm on your own
\end{block}
\begin{block}{STEP-4}
Making library of sorting functions
\end{block}
\begin{block}{STEP-5}
 Plot the results
\end{block}



\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CONCLUSION}

From the different algorithms of sorting we came to know that merge sorting and quick sort are fastest among all the sorting algorithms.
They are followed by insertion sort.
Then comes the selection sort and bubble sort in the end with the least efficiency.
